Internet-Draft           UMA Scope Registration              August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Scope Registration Protocol provides a method for a UMA Host to
   register scopes with an UMA Authorization Manager.

   Scopes are basically simple strings which only have meaning to the
   Host and are completely transparent to the Authorization Manager.
   For instance a scope can be all photos of a Host being marked as "for
   family only" or all photos of a certain resolution.

   Scopes are registered with an AM by the Host and can be revoked again
   at any time.

   Resources are bundled to scopes only on the Host side.  The
   Authorization Manager never knows in advance which resource (and thus
   URI pointing to one) falls under which scope unless a request is made
   to a resource in which case the Host informs the Authorization
   Manager about the scopes it falls under.  The Authorization Manager
   can then make a decision based on the scope information if access is
   granted or not.

   In order to do so, resource owners attach policies to scopes.  This
   can be as simple as being asked on every request or as complex as
   fulfilling a chain of claims.  The resolution of those policy
   questions is out of scope for this specification though and is part
   of the UMA core protocol specification.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging].  Additionally, the realm and auth-
   param rules are included from [RFC2617].

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

1.2.  Terminology

   We use the same terminology as the UMA core protocol specification.

   Scope
         A scope is a string known to a Host describing a set of
         resources.  An Authorization Manager can add policies to those
         scopes which are checked on resource access.  Scopes

         additionally have a description in order to explain it to the
         user.


2.  Prerequisites

   In order for a Host to be able to register scopes with an
   Authorization Manager it needs to fulfill the following
   prerequisites:

      The Host has obtained an access token from the Authorization
      Manager as explained in the UMA core protocol specification, step
      1.  It can use this token to use the scope registration API of the
      Authorization Manager.

      The Host has obtained an the URI of the scope registration API as
      part of the Authorization Manager's metadata as described in the
      UMA core protocol specification, step 1.

      The Host has already defined scopes for itself.  These are often
      derivable from the functionality of the Host.  For instance a
      photo site could already have scopes defined like "photos only
      visible for my family", "photos in a certain group", "photos
      tagged with a certain tag".  The Host needs to define unique
      strings for those scopes.


3.  Registering scopes

   The following substeps are performed in order for a Host to register
   scopes with an Authorization Manager.

   1.  The Host creates a JSON formatted document describing all the
       scopes it wishes to register or to delete.

   2.  The Host sends this document to the Authorization Manager's scope
       registration API, using the access token it obtained in step 1 of
       the UMA core protocol.

   3.  The Authorization Manager acknowledges that it received the
       scopes.

3.1.  Preparing the scope registration document

   The Host collects all the scopes available to the user the
   Authorization Manager's access token is valid for and creates a JSON
   document of the following form:

       {
           'add' : [
                       {
                           'scope' : 'photos_family',
                           'desc'  : 'Photos available to my family',
                           'desc_de' : 'Fotos f&uuml;r meine Familie',
                       },
                       {
                           'scope' : 'group_fun',
                           'desc'  : 'Funny Photos',
                       }
                   ],
           'delete' : ['photos_private']
       }


   It lists all the scopes it wished to be added with a description
   (optionally in multiple languages) in the section "add" and it lists
   all those (previously registered) scopes in the "delete" section it
   wants to have deleted.  In the latter case it only needs to list the
   scope names. [[ add description of field names ]]

3.2.  Host sending the Scope Registration document

   The Host sends the crafted document to the Scope Registration API
   endpoint it obtained during metadata discovery.  It uses the POST
   method to do so. [[ describe this further with examples ]]

3.3.  Authorization Manager sending a response

   The Authorization Manager answers with a response containing "ok" in
   the case of success or with an error message. [[ describe this
   further with examples and use some standard way to do so across the
   protocol]]

   Who needs security anyway these days?
